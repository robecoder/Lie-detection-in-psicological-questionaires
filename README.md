# Lie-detection-in-psicological-questionnaires
In this project we develop a procedure to addres the problem of Lie detection in psicologycal questionnaries.
Usually a psicological questionnaire is composed of sentences, and for each sentence the respondee has to rate how much he/she agrees with that sentence,
on a scale from 1 to 5 for example.
Here we address specifically three problems: 
- Detecting if a questionnarie has been faked;
- Detecting exactly which question has been faked;
- Recostructing what would be the honest response given the faked answer.

For this project, the dataset has been produced from 412 individuals whose were asked to answer to the questionnaire once in a honest manner
and once in dishonest manner, such that to fake  particular traits of personality.
